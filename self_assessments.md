# Self Assessments

Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation you should study beforehand, make/do, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle.

You will synthesis what you are noticing in your notebook, readings, writings, and creating with regard to your learning. Each self assessment should have a minimum of three citations from lectures, weekly discussions, and/or readings. What measures are you going to take to improve your work in and for class? Are these weekly actionable tasks? Tell me about it.

There will be two self assessments for the course. One will be due at midterm and the other at the end of the semester. These reflective writings will require you to critically evaluate your process and execution in the class. 

**Each assessment should be direct messaged to the instructor as a pdf on Slack or handed in on paper.**
