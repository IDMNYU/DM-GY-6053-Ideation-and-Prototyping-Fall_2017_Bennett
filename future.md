# Future Dystopia / Utopia Project


_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

Imagine our civilization 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population. What message would you send? You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build prototypes your message. You will communicate your message in any final medium you choose. The only requirement is that it includes images, models, or video of your prototype(s).

I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

*   Animals
*   Commerce
*   Education
*   Engineering
*   Ethics
*   Information
*   Materiality
*   Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
*   Memory
*   Nature
*   Networks
*   Ruins
*   Science
*   Sexuality
*   Systems
*   The Object
*   Technology
*   Time
