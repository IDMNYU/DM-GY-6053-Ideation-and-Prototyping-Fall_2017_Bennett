# Final Project


_This project can be done as a team or as an individual._

For the final project in this course, you will be creating a speculative design project. Speculative design also goes by many other names. Depending on who you talk to, they might call it: 

* Critical Design
* Design Fiction
* Discursive Design
* Interrogative Design
* Ludic Design

# Future Dystopia / Utopia Project

Imagine our civilization 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population. 

* What does your imagined future look, sound, and feel like? (your framing story)

* What message would you transmit to the current population from the future?

* You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build physical prototypes of an object(s) from your imagined future.

* You will deliver your message in any final medium(s) you choose. The only requirement is that it includes image(s), physical or virtual model(s), or video(s) of your prototyped physical object(s).

I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

*   Animals
*   Commerce
*   Education
*   Engineering
*   Ethics
*   Information
*   Materiality
*   Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
*   Memory
*   Nature
*   Networks
*   Ruins
*   Science
*   Sexuality
*   Systems
*   The Object
*   Technology
*   Time
