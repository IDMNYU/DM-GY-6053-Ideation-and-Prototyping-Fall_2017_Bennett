## Welcome to Ideation &amp; Prototyping!

In this class, the creative process will be investigated in order to generate ideas for art, design, technology, and business endeavors. The course will show how ideation, design research &amp; thinking, and prototyping can inspire, inform, and bring depth to what one ultimately creates. Students will expand their arsenal of design research skills, learn how to think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes, as well as, understand the importance of utilizing more than one research and design strategy.

Prerequisite: None

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

*   develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
*   develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
*   develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
*   develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### COURSE GOALS

To get students to:

*   develop a rigorous, iterative process for looking, questioning, thinking, making, and communicating that challenges assumptions and preconceived ideas
*   use their imagination to create something entirely new &amp; innovative OR to reinvent an old idea into something new
*   introduce students to the many research &amp; design methodologies available to them
*   develop skills of description, research, analysis, visualization, design and critical thinking.
*   improve writing, documentation, and presentation skills
*   facilitate collaboration


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course students should be able to:

*   to search and spot ideas, and transform these invisible ideas into visible realizations


### COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will be comprised of lectures, critiques, discussions, readings, screenings, exercises, projects, and a collaborative research paper.

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. The class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the impact of your project. The feedback is about how the work is coming across as well as ways to expand it. It is not about you personally, but your work. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your critique notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand what you are doing to make your project better. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

There will be discrete team and individual exercises and projects that require you to apply the tools, techniques, and methods presented in the lectures, discussions, readings, and other material. These fundamentals are organized according to five phases:

**Phase 1: Discovery / Inspiration**

*   Seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, feeling
*   Collecting, obsessing, hoarding
*   Reappropriating, remixing

**Phase 2: Research / Ideation / Brainstorming**

*   Asking and listening
*   Visual researching
*   Materials researching
*   User / audience researching and ethnographic researching
*   Systems researching
*   Activity researching
*   Primary researching
*   Scholarly researching
*   Brainstorming, gamestorming, ideation

**Phase 3: Design / Sketching / Mapping**

*   Visualizing, drawing, sketching
*   Planning and mapping
*   Grouping, clustering, comparing, contrasting
*   Organizing and designing
*   Reorganizing and redesigning
*   Shaping and forming
*   Discerning and revealing
*   Connecting and disconnecting

**Phase 4: Prototyping**

*   Making, building, creating
*   Rapid prototyping
*   Iterating
*   Selecting and editing
*   Breaking then repeating all of the above

**Phase 5: Positioning / Pitching**

*   Framing and positioning
*   Storytelling, engaging, communicating, selling



### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time and participate (be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmate(s)
* Devote at a minimum 6 to 8 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Consult slack at least once a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Give your classmates constructive feedback. Don't be passive in critiques or take it personally. Push everyone's ideas further.
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Direct message me on slack re: contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) only
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not direct message me long conversations on slack. (if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.)
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 3 tardies (15 minutes or more), you accure an absence. See above
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or via direct message on slack is preferred).
* Attendance is mandatory for the midterm and final presentations / critiques. No exceptions. Critiques can not be made up.
* Work is still due on due dates, regardless of whether you are in class or not.
*Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Consult the syllabus. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was discussed. Speak to several of them and at length.



#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative &amp; qualitative rubrics:

* Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the due date.
* Each student will be judged on the commitment, fearlessness, and continuous improvement that their work shows. Incomplete or unsatisfactory work will receive a failing grade.

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. The experience is better for everyone in the class, if everyone can be present and active. It not only helps you, but it helps your neighbor. Again, we live in a community and we must think beyond our own needs.

[Read Clay Shirky's thoughts on students & laptops in the classroom.](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.ong79i9mw)

When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.

Be forewarned, that if you are chronically in your devices and not participating in conversation, you will be called upon. Class is a community.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.
