# Printed Assignment Guidelines

As with all written work, proofread for spelling and grammar. This is where working as a team will come in handy.

Any printed work that you will turn in, should always contain the following:

*   Date
*   Your first and last name
*   Ideation &amp; Prototyping
*   Fall 2017
*   Bennett

**All written assignments should be submitted as a pdf on slack as a direct message to the instructor.**
