# Recommended Resources

**Recommended Audio Podcasts**

*   _The Tim Ferriss Show_ Tim Ferriss deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, sports, business, art, etc.) to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use. This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more.
*   _Unmistakeable Creative_Srini Rao interviews instigators, rebels, and people with a pathological inability to accept the status quo.
*   _Revision Path_ Maurice Cherry interviews designers, developers, and other creators of color weekly.
*   _StartUp Podcast_StartUp is a podcast series about what it’s really like to get a business off the ground.
    *   In Season 1, Alex Blumberg told the story of launching this business, Gimlet Media, a podcast network.
    *   In Season 2, Lisa Chow joined Alex to follow an entirely new company: a company called Dating Ring, founded by two women in their 20s, outsiders in the male-dominated world of Silicon Valley.
    *   In Season 3, rather than following one company over many episodes, they are telling stories about many companies that all have something in common: their companies are stuck, and they know they need to make a big change.
