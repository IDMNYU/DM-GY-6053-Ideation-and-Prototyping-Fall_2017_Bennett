# Constant Input Choices

Choose either for the entire semester. **Do not do both**:

*   Discovery Log or
*   Creative Process Project: Individual (or Collaborative) Daily, Weekly, or Monthly

#### Discovery Log

*   Each week’s discovery log is due at least 1 hour BEFORE the beginning of class. However, I suggest that you don't wait until the last minute. I would suggest posting as you discover.
*   Discovery logs can NOT be submitted after each due date.
*   If you didn’t discover anything new, post literally that you did not discover anything new this week.

What’s new and different in your life in the following categories? Why does it appeal to you or not? **Post on your process website on a daily or weekly basis.**

*   _Entertainment_ (Movies, Sports, Theater, Music, Museums, Zoos, Theme Parts, etc.)
*   _Media_ (Newspapers, Magazines, Books, TV, Radio, Internet, etc.)
*   _Food_ (Restaurants, Snacks, Home-Cooked Meals, Etc.)
*   _Hobbies_ (Skateboarding, Knitting, etc.)
*   _People_ (Friends, Strangers, Customers, Coworkers, etc.)
*   _Non-school Lectures, workshops, and documentaries._

#### Personal Creative Process Project: Individual (or Collaborative), Daily, Weekly or Monthly

*   Select a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly schedule and create and promote a self- or team- directed project using social media and/or analog promotional materials.
    *   If weekly, at least 12 times
    *   If bi-weekly, at least 6 times
    *   If monthly, at least 3 times
*   Post or embed within your process website your chosen schedule with specific dates and share the link with your instructor.

**Also remember it does NOT have to be digital or visual.** It could be aural (i.e. music or soundscapes), culinary, etc. etc. times a gazillion possibilities. **The main requirement is that it is a creative project.**
